Workflow.IgnoredNonConnectedTask=Ignoring non-connected workflow task.
Workflow.ExecutionException=Workflow execution of task %VAR% failed with exception message: %VAR%.
Workflow.ScenarioExecutionException=Workflow execution of scenario vertex failed with exception message: %VAR%.
Workflow.NullNodeOutput=Workflow execution of node %VAR% returned the output null.
